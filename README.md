# The World Below
The World Below is an in-development adventure game built in Unity. It is rooted heavily in Filipino folklore, and tells the story of a girl who has fallen from her home in the sky. The player takes on the role of the girl, and must explore the world in order to get back home.

This game was conceived by [Nicole Cischke](https://github.com/cischken) for her senior design project at the University of Michigan. She and [Jacob Haas](https://github.com/haasjac) created a small world for the player to explore, which eventually became the prototype for our current project. Our team now plans to expand that world, incorporating more of the folklore and creating a full, story-driven experience for the player.

We're still early in the development process, and we haven't released much information about the game yet. We will have more of a media presence as the game matures, so keep an eye out for us! For now, know that we are working hard on bringing you a quality game to enjoy.

Thank you for your interest.<br>
